# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: An instance variable is similar to state object key-value pairs in React. Instance variables that belong to a class in ruby. They are different from other variables in that they cannot be accessed outside of the class, but only through methods in the class.

  Researched answer: Instance variables are private while other variable are public. Instance variables do not need to be declare, like other variables in Ruby



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block is like a higher order function in JavaScript. It is a fuction tha tis built into Ruby which takes fucntions -- that the user defines -- as parameters. Blocks often have to do with iterables.

  Researched answer: A block is chucnck of code that is passed into a method like an object to be executed by the higher method. Blocks are like anonymous functions.



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: This means that the last line in a function or if statement will be returned even if the keyword "return" is not there.

  Researched answer: In Ruby, every statement will return the last evaluated expression.



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is where the main data type in the code is objects. The logic around the code revolves around classes and objects and what theses objects are able to do. This is different from functional programming where functions serve as the basis, or most central aspect, to the code. 

  Researched answer: OOP programming puts data and behavior together, in objects, while in FP, data and behavior are kept separate.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is like a blueprint while an object is a actual building based on that blueprint. A class gives the information of what a potential object of that class might look and behave like.

  Researched answer: This is pretty much the answer



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- PostgreSQL: An open source database with object-releated code to crate databases.
- API: Application programming interface. I basically understand them to be pre-set sommands for other applications that carry out a set task without the developer really needing to know how it works. It's like picking something off of the menu at a restaurant and then the people in the kitchen cook it. You don't know how they did, but it worked.
- CRUD: AN acronym for the 4 basic SQL commands: create, read, update, delete.
- Ruby on Rails: A set of programming tools, or a framework, to help build web applications, particularly the backend end side.
- ORM: It's writing queries in your back end in object oriented style syntax.
- Active Record: The interface that rails gives to interact between your app and database.
